#Playing With Spritz

Out of curiosity I wanted to see what Spritz SDK could do. I went through their tutorial and created a small app where the user can read 'The Moon Under Water' by George Orwell in under two minutes.

##Objectives

* To learn about the Spritz Javascript SDK
* To create a small speed-reading app.
* To learn more about HAML.

##Techologies

* Javscript/JQuery
* Spritz SDK
* Sinatra
* HAML

##Heroku
